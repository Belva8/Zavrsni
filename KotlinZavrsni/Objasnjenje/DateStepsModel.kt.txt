This code defines a class named DateStepsModel, which serves as a data model for storing date and corresponding step count information. Here's an explanation of its components:

Class Declaration:

kotlin
Copy code
class DateStepsModel {
This line declares the class named DateStepsModel.

Properties:

mDate: Represents the date for which step count information is recorded. It's stored as a string.
mStepCount: Represents the number of steps taken on the corresponding date. It's stored as an integer.
Initialization:

kotlin
Copy code
var mDate: String = ""
var mStepCount: Int = 0
Each property is initialized with a default value:

mDate is initialized as an empty string ("").
mStepCount is initialized as 0.
This class is designed to hold date-step count pairs. It's likely used to encapsulate and manage step count data for different dates within the pedometer application. Instances of this class allow for convenient organization and manipulation of step count information.
