package com.example.kotlinzavrsni
This statement declares the package where this class resides.

Import Statements:

kotlin

import android.content.Intent
import android.os.Bundle
import android.widget.ListView
import androidx.appcompat.app.AppCompatActivity
These statements import necessary classes and modules required for this code. For instance, Intent for starting services, Bundle for passing data between activities, ListView for displaying a list of items, and AppCompatActivity for creating activities compatible with the AppCompat library.

Class Declaration:

kotlin

class StepsHistoryActivity : AppCompatActivity() {
This line declares a class named StepsHistoryActivity which extends AppCompatActivity. This means that StepsHistoryActivity is an activity in Android that supports the modern material design theme.

Member Variables:

kotlin

private lateinit var mStepsDBHelper: StepsDBHelper
private lateinit var mSensorListView: ListView
private lateinit var mListAdapter: ListAdapter
private lateinit var mStepCountList: ArrayList<DateStepsModel>
These variables are declared but not initialized yet. They will be initialized later in the code.

onCreate() Method:

kotlin

override fun onCreate(savedInstanceState: Bundle?) {
    super.onCreate(savedInstanceState)
    setContentView(R.layout.pedometerlist_layout)
    mSensorListView = findViewById(R.id.steps_list)

    getDataForList()

    mListAdapter = ListAdapter(mStepCountList, this)
    mSensorListView.adapter = mListAdapter

    val stepsIntent = Intent(applicationContext, StepsService::class.java)
    startService(stepsIntent)
}
This method is called when the activity is starting. It sets the layout for the activity from the XML layout resource named pedometerlist_layout. It initializes the mSensorListView variable with the ListView component defined in the layout. Then, it calls the getDataForList() method to retrieve data for the list from a database using StepsDBHelper. After getting the data, it creates a new instance of ListAdapter with the obtained data and sets this adapter to the mSensorListView. Finally, it starts a service named StepsService using an intent.

getDataForList() Method:

kotlin

private fun getDataForList() {
    mStepsDBHelper = StepsDBHelper(this)
    mStepCountList = mStepsDBHelper.readStepsEntries()
}
This method initializes mStepsDBHelper with a new instance of StepsDBHelper and calls its readStepsEntries() method to retrieve step count entries from the database. The retrieved data is stored in the mStepCountList.

This activity is responsible for displaying the history of step counts retrieved from the database in a ListView. It initializes the ListView with the data using a custom adapter and starts a service for updating step counts in real-time.
